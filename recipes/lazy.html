    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The perfect solution for those lazy days, especially if you live in a big
      city!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Variery of food apps to your liking</li>
      <li>1x large apettite</li>
      <li>1x credit card</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Launch your food delivery app. This can be done from your couch or even
        your bed
      </li>
      <li>
        Browse the catalogue to find out what looks appealing today. How about
        some mexican, or chinese? You can never go wrong with pizza or ramen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pick a (few) items and remember to account for your hunger. I always end
        up ordering too much!
      </li>
      <li>Set your address and credit card details.</li>
      <li>
        Get over the shock of the fees, taxes, and tips applied to your order.
        Order it anyway, you are hungry and already spent way too much time
        picking something out.
      </li>
      <li>Follow the app tracking and the delivery driver to your address.</li>
      <li>Set the table in anticipation of your food.</li>
      <li>
        Open your door once your delivery arrives. Remember to put on some
        pants, if needed.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy your lazy meal!</li>
    </ol>
