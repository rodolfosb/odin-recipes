    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1x large Ribeye steak (approx. 350g) about 3cm thick</li>
      <li>1x tbsp grape seed Oil (or other with high smoke point)</li>
      <li>4x tbsp salted butter</li>
      <li>5x garlic cloves</li>
      <li>A few thyme or rosemary sprigs</li>
      <li>Flaky sea salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Remove the ribeye steak an hour prior to cooking, allowing it to reach
        room temperature naturally
      </li>
      <li>
        Pat dry the ribeye with paper towels. This is a secret for a nice crust!
      </li>
      <li>Set your frying pan (preferably cast iron) to high heat.</li>
      <li>
        Add a generous amount of flaky sea salt over both sides of the steak.
        Repeat with black pepper to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the grape seed oil to the pan and let it heat up. Add the steak just
        before it starts smoking.
      </li>
      <li>Add the garlic cloves and the thyme/rosemary sprigs.</li>
      <li>
        Fry the steak for about 3 minutes on each side. Don't move it around too
        much to allow for a nice crust to form.
      </li>
      <li>Add the butter to the pan.</li>
      <li>
        Fry an additional 2 minutes on each side of the steak, basting it in the
        melted butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the steak from the pan and let it rest for 5 minutes before
        slicing. This will help finish the cooking and to keep the meat juices
        sealed in the meat.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the steak is resting, add a small amount of water to the pan and
        let it boil. Scrape the brown bits from the pan and let it reduce for a
        couple of minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the thyme/rosemary sprigs and discard. Drizzle the juices from
        the pan along with the garlic over the steak. You can also add this to a
        saucer and serve at the table.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy while it is still warm and fresh!</li>
    </ol>
